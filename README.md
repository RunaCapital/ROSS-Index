## Overview

The **Runa Open Source Startup (ROSS) Index** publishes the top trending open-source startups by the growth rate of GitHub stars at their repositories. Such an approach allows for highlighting those OSS products that were on top of developers' minds during the past quarter or year.

Runa Capital actively invests in open-source startups (like [Nginx](https://runacap.com/companies/nginx/) and [MariaDB](https://runacap.com/companies/mariadb/)) and considers an active developer community instrumental for software businesses. The firm tracks promising tech companies with fast-growing developer communities on GitHub and open-sources part of their findings as this index.

## Key Features

- **Transparent**: Simple, verifiable methodology based on public GitHub data
- **Measurable**: Uses GitHub stars as a consistent metric across projects
- **Startup-Focused**: Exclusively highlights commercial open-source startups, not established companies or side projects
- **Quarterly Updates**: Published every quarter with annual summaries

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The ROSS Index collects data on all repositories with **1,000+ GitHub stars**. The top trending open-source startups affiliated with these repos are published on a quarterly or annual basis.

### Ranking Criteria

Repositories are ranked based on their **maximum star growth rate** over all 90-day periods ending within the target quarter.

#### Calculation Method (Since Q1 2024)

The index uses a sliding "90-day window" approach to detect fast-growing repos even if their growth spike happened between calendar periods. This methodology was updated in Q1 2024 to better capture trending startups.

#### Previous Calculation Method (2020-2023)

Previously, the relative growth of stars was calculated within a fixed period (quarter or year) for all repos with at least 1,000 stars at the start of the period, using:

**AGR = (value now / value 1 quarter ago)⁴ – 1**

### Why GitHub Stars?

Stars were chosen as the primary metric because they:
- Allow reasonable comparison between various repos using the same scale
- Show trending open-source products
- Are publicly verifiable and transparent

While no metric is perfect for open-source software, stars are considered the best single metric for index purposes. Other metrics like "contributors" are good for comparing similar projects but cannot be easily used across different categories of software.

### Why Relative Growth?

The index measures **relative growth** (not absolute) to shift focus from established open-source champions to interesting newcomers in the developer community. GitHub has network effects, making it easier to acquire stars for already well-starred repos, but this index is specifically about startups.

### Selection Process

1. Repositories are ranked by their growth rate in descending order
2. The team selects only repos belonging to startups
3. The top-20 are published in the ranking
4. If a startup has several top repos, only the one with the best growth rate is mentioned

## Startup Definition

For purposes of the index, a "startup" is defined as a **product-focused commercial organization** that meets certain criteria.

This definition **does not cover**:
- Side projects (e.g., when a founder has another full-time job)
- Projects without any associated commercial product-focused entity
- Projects developed by large tech corporations
- Businesses mostly focused on the provision of professional services

### Open Source License Approach

As VC investors, Runa Capital sticks to the commercial perception of "open-source". The index considers companies like Elastic and MongoDB as commercial open-source companies, although their Server Side Public Licenses are not approved by the OSI. The same applies to many participants of the ROSS Index.

## Data Sources and Transparency

The index publications are based only on **public data** from:
- GitHub
- Crunchbase
- Mass media
- Other public sources

The index strives to show cities and countries connected with the **origin of companies**, not just formal HQ locations. It is purely focused on companies using English descriptions, so some local startups (e.g., Chinese) could be missed.

Given the open-source nature of data, some inaccuracies are possible. Runa Capital does not use any private information received from startups for the index. For instance, they may know that a company raised a new VC round but will only publish publicly available numbers like those on Crunchbase.
